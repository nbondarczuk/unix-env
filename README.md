# Unix env

## Purpose

Having machines/instances of Unixlike sytems of various brands like Mac OS X, Linux, etc.
makes always problem with general setup. I finally grabbed few of the files 
and I creaed a setup files to be distributed all over the machines/instances.

## Usage

Make is used to:
- **help**    is given
- **install** the environment with provides config files
- **save**    the existing local setup to VCS (first this dir)

This is how the make file targets are organized.
