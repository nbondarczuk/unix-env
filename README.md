# Unix env

## Purpose

Having few instance of sytems in different brands like Mac OS X, Linux, etc.
makes always problem with general setup. I finally grabbed few of the files 
and I creaed a setup files to be distributed all over the machines/instances.

## Usage

Make is ised to:
- install the environment
- save the existing setup with modifications.

This is how the make file targets are organized.
